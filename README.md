# `traytable`
### A python package for tabulating crystallization results across many trays  
`traytable` provides methods for storing all information about a crystallization screen in a dictionary of dictionaries, and methods for extracting and tabulating all data about "hits" into a `pandas` dataframe. The goal of `traytable` is for all crystallization data to be inputted once and only once, and then conveniently looked up and reused whenever needed.

You can find a jupyter notebook with a brief demonstration of package functionality [here](https://github.com/dennisbrookner/traytable/blob/main/sample.ipynb).

#### Installation
```bash
pip install traytable
```
